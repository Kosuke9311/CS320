Title: Communication Networks

This is focused on the communication networks in terms of LAN, MAN, WAN, HAN, PAN. I leaned what advantage and disadvantage of each of them, how work for transmitting the data, how they are connected each other,  construction, and design. I realized again that they always exist around us, and they are indispensable for our life. 

Mainly I wrote based on the source of Internet.
